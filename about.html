<p>Hi! I am Shagun Sodhani. I am a final year Computer Science Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee</a>.
 
<p>I am a programmer at heart. Software Developement takes most of my time though I regularly devote time to Competitve Programming as well. I am interested in Data Sciences and Theoretical CS. I love to play around with technology.

<p>I interned with ATL(Research) Division of Adobe during the summer of 2014. There I got to work with some cool stuff including ibeacons and learnt R, Mongodb, Solr and much more.

<p>On campus I am involved with 3 tech groups . I am the secretary and one of the founders at <a href = "http://www.iitr.ac.in/acm">ACM Student Chapter, IIT Roorkee</a>. I have been a member of <a href = "https://sdslabs.co/" >SDSLabs</a> (Software Development Section of IIT Roorkee) since my first year. I also served as the Coordinator at <a href = "https://pag.sdslabs.co/" >PAG</a> (Programming and Algorithms Group) in my third year.
 
<p>My mantra for life is : 
<p><strong><i>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</strong></i>
<br>- Steve Jobs</i>

<p>Feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:sshagunsodhani@gmail.com">sshagunsodhani@gmail.com</a> and I would be glad to talk.
